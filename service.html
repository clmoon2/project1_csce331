      I try to contribute where I live and grew up. These are the three service activities I’m most proud of:
      mentoring kids in La Joya, supporting residents at a nursing home in Mission, and helping with food service at a local soup kitchen in Mission.
      Each experience strengthened skills I rely on in class and on teams: patience, clear communication, and reliability.

      <h2 id="lj-elementary">Mentoring at La Joya Elementary (La Joya, TX)</h2>
      <p>
        I volunteer with kids from La Joya Elementary, focusing on homework help, reading practice, and basic computer literacy.
        With the younger grades, I keep sessions playful and structured (short tasks, quick feedback). With older students, I introduce
        simple problem-solving habits—breaking big tasks into smaller steps and checking work out loud.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Activities: reading fluency drills, math practice, typing basics, and safe computer use</li>
        <li>Approach: positive reinforcement, bite-size goals, and progress notes for parents/teachers</li>
        <li>Outcome: measurable improvements in attention to directions and confidence during classwork</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="mission-nursing-home">Nursing Home Support (Mission, TX)</h2>
      <p>
        At a nursing home in Mission, I spend time with residents—conversation visits, reading, board/card games—and help with light tech tasks
        like setting up devices, adjusting accessibility settings, and showing how to make video calls to family.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Activities: companionship visits, activity assistance, device setup, and photo/video call help</li>
        <li>Focus: patience, dignity, and clear explanations without jargon</li>
        <li>Outcome: consistent weekly presence residents can count on and smoother contact with loved ones</li>
      </ul>

    <section aria-labelledby="mission-soup-kitchen">
      <h2 id="mission-soup-kitchen">Soup Kitchen Volunteer (Mission, TX)</h2>
      <p>
        I assist at a soup kitchen handling food prep, serving, and cleanup. When it’s busy, I rotate jobs to keep the line moving and
        coordinate supplies so we avoid bottlenecks (utensils, trays, water). After hours, I help with basic inventory notes for the next shift.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Activities: prepping ingredients, portioning meals, dishwashing, and end-of-day cleanup</li>
        <li>Teamwork: clear roles during rushes, quick handoffs, and safety/cleanliness checks</li>
        <li>Outcome: reliable coverage during peak times and smoother transitions between volunteer shifts</li>
      </ul>
