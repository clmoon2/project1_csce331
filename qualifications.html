        I enjoy building software that is easy to understand and easy to change. In courses and club projects,
        I’ve learned that the fastest route to a reliable feature is to start with clear requirements, write the smallest useful slice,
        and keep the feedback loop short. I lean on semantic HTML for structure and keyboard-friendly navigation so that content
        works before any styling is applied. From there, I iterate: I test flows by hand, read the UI like a user would,
        and remove anything that creates friction. When I write code, I prioritize descriptive names, predictable data flow,
        and small functions over clever one-liners. These choices make it easier for teammates to review and for me to change
        the code later when needs evolve.

        I’m most interested in frontend engineering and the intersection with computer-science fundamentals.
        On the frontend, I like thinking about accessibility and performance. I use resources like
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">W3C’s WAI intros</a> to ensure headings, labels,
        and landmarks are correct, and I read <a href="https://web.dev/fast/">web.dev guidance</a> to reason about delivery,
        responsiveness, and interaction. On the CS side, I practice algorithms and data structures so that when problems
        appear in a UI—lists, graphs, scheduling—I have patterns I can adapt. I document what I learn in short notes so
        I can reuse the ideas later.
      </p>

        As a teammate, I value direct but respectful communication. I make sure that all my teamates feel at home, I want their experience to be amazing always. I write issue descriptions that state the goal,
        constraints, and acceptance checks. In code review, I try to be specific about what would make the change clearer
        or safer. I’m comfortable saying “I don’t know” and asking for context. My goal in an internship is to work on
        user-facing features where I can take ownership, keep the scope focused, and grow through feedback from engineers
        who care about quality and maintainability.
